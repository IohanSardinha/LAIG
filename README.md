# LAIG(Graphical Interface Laboratories) Project

The project revolved around creating 3 scenes and developing 1 game. All scenes were built on Javascript using the WebCGF framework, the last scene which was made for the game used .obj files for the scene and Prolog for the game logic.

## 1st Project ##

This project's goal was building a scene that contained the following elements: 

- Primitives and geometry building.
- Geometric transformations.
- Materials.
- Textures.
- Graphical interface.

## 2nd Project ##

This project's goal was enhancing the scene created for the 1st project the enhancements were: 

- Animations using keyframes.
- Spritesheets for text and animations.
- 2D and 3D Surfaces (nurbs).

## 3rd Project ##

This project's goal was implementing the graphical interface for a board game that had its logic implemented in prolog.The elements that were implemented were: 

- Different scenes containing elements of the game and scenery.
- Pieces and keyframe animations for them.
- Different environments and illumination.
- Game funcionality like difficulty and gamemodes.
- Link with prolog gamelogic.
- Additional features.
